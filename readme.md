# This is my second go at creating my professional website. After taking a bootcamp to improve my html and css skills, I've decided to redo my site with my new knowledge.

## Update 1: Initiation
Created the project, added all pages and images, as well as creating the navbar with bootstrap and custom code.

## Update 2: Home Page
* Added borders to the mobile navbar.
* Created header section for the home page.

## Update 3: Skills Section
* Created the skills section, and gave it a responsive layout.

## Update 4: Overview Section
* Created three columns for github, video, and audio content.
