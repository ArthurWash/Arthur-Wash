# This is my second go at creating my professional website. After taking a bootcamp to improve my html and css skills, I've decided to redo my site with my new knowledge.

## Update 1: Initiation
Created the project, added all pages and images, as well as creating the navbar with bootstrap and custom code.

## Update 2: Home Page
* Added borders to the mobile navbar.
* Created header section for the home page.

## Update 3: Skills Section
* Created the skills section, and gave it a responsive layout.

## Update 4: Overview Section
* Created three columns for github, video, and audio content.

## Update 5: Latest Content Section; Homepage Complete!
* Created the Latest Content Section.
* Completed the homepage! This includes:
    * Navbar with links to the homepage, website portfolio, video portfolio, audio portfolio, about me, and contact pages.
    * Header with a subtitle, as well as icons that lead to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and SoundCloud pages.
    * Skills Section which gives brief descriptions of each skill I'm promoting.
    * An Overview Section with thumbnails that lead to my GitHub, Video Demo Reel, and Audio Demo Reel.
    * Latest Content Section, with thumbnails to my latest work in each field, and buttons that go to their respective skill pages.

## Update 6: Web Dev Portfolio Complete
* Created the Web Dev Portfolio page.

## Update 7: Video Portfolio Complete
* Created the Video Portfolio page, which uses a giant video on top for the demo reel, and a 4x3 grid for the other videos.

## Update 8: Audio Portfolio Complete
* Created the Audio Portfolio page. Same as video portfolio page but with links to audio.

## Update 9: About Me Page Created, Structure Complete.
* Created the about me page. This includes two buttons that lead to my resumes, a photo of myself, and an about me paragraph section. This is pretty much complete, but I will be updating my video resume and the about me paragraph before the official release.

## Update 10: Contact Page Complete
* Created the contact page. All that is left is to fix the video resume and paragraph on the about me page!

## Update 11: Website Complete!
* The website is finished! All page structures are complete.
* In the future, there will be minor updates, such as changing content for portfolios.
