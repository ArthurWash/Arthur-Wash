# This is my second go at creating my professional website. After taking a bootcamp to improve my html and css skills, I've decided to redo my site with my new knowledge.

## Update 1: Initiation
Created the project, added all pages and images, as well as creating the navbar with bootstrap and custom code.

## Update 2: Home Page
* Added borders to the mobile navbar.
* Created header section for the home page.
